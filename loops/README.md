# Loops

## Key Concepts
- Types of Loops
  - While loops
  - For loops
- Loop Concepts
  - Indeces vs elements
  - Keywords `continue` and `break`
  - Looping over strings
  - Looping by other numbers (not just by 1)
  - Looping forward & backward


## Lesson
- How to **explain** the concept:
  - Pre-recorded video lecture going over loops (link below)
  - Pre-recorded demo with the demo code
- How to **assess** that apprentice had understood the concept
  - Can the apprentice pass the tests in the automated tests?
- Deliberate **practice** for the apprentice
  - The assignments/tests are the practice
